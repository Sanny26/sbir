# Sketch Based Image Retrieval

## Project Objective:
The aim of this project is to build a system that is able to retrieve relevant and appropriate images when a sketch image is given as a query to the system. The retrieved images may be sketches or colored/digital images. The system will be trained to identify the best possible match for a given sketch image to a subset of relevant images.

## Problem Definition:
In a Sketch Based Image Retrieval(SBIR) system, a given query sketch needs to be compared with images available in a database to retrieve images that are relevant to the query. This is a special type of Content Based Image Retrieval(CBIR) system, similar to the one used in Google’s Image search(Search by Image), where an image is used to find similar images in Google’s database.

## Expected Outcome:
The final outcome of this project would be an accurate SBIR system, that is able to retrieve relevant images for a given sketch query image with a reasonable amount of accuracy. We will have training and test sets to measure this accuracy of the system. We will also create an interface wherein people can upload their own images to search for relevant images in our database using the SBIR system. For experimentation purposes, we limit the results to 10 retrieved images per query.
